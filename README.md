### Installation

To run this microservices project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microblogging-platform.git
cd microblogging-platform
```

1. Install dependencies for each microservice:
```bash
cd user-service
npm install

cd ../post-service
npm install

# Repeat for other microservices
```
1.Set up the required environment variables (see Configuration).
2. Start the microservices:
```bash
cd user-service
npm start

cd ../post-service
npm start

# Repeat for other microservices
```
## Usage
Once the microservices are running, you can access the microblogging platform through a web browser or API client. Sign up, create posts, and explore the features.

## Architecture
This microservices project follows a microservices architecture pattern. It consists of the following microservices:

User Service: Manages user registration, authentication, and profile information.
Post Service: Handles post creation, retrieval, and interactions.
Notification Service: Sends notifications to users about new followers and post interactions.
API Gateway: Acts as an entry point for the frontend and routes requests to the appropriate microservice.
These microservices communicate with each other using HTTP RESTful APIs and message queues.

- Post Service API: [Link to Post Service API Documentation]
- Notification Service API: [Link to Notification Service API Documentation]
  
## Configuration
To configure the microservices, create environment-specific configuration files or set environment variables for each microservice. For example, you may need to specify database connection details, secret keys, and external service endpoints.

## Deployment
For deployment to production, use containerization (e.g., Docker) and container orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes). Detailed deployment instructions can be found in each microservice's documentation.

## Monitoring
We use centralized logging and monitoring tools such as Prometheus and Grafana to monitor the health and performance of our microservices. Logs are stored in a centralized location for easy debugging and analysis.
